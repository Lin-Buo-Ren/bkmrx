TODO

- All bookmarks added to system are currently searchable by all users, regardless of whether they
  are marked as private or not; hence there is a potential privacy issue
- Implement integration for other third party services such as Facebook, Readability, etc
- Prettify profile pages
- Implement 'follow' function
- Move away from default bootstrap theme
- Allow users to set a default privacy setting for all imported bookmarks
- Fix UTF8 handling in search results pages
